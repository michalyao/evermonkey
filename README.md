## Features

You can use `ever new` to create an untitle file with metadata support, edit it and use `ever publish` to publish it to evernote. And of course more than that.

Why EverMonkey is better? EverMonkey is inspired by the Sublime Text one, make local cache to avoid making net request everytime and in result
you got a faster experience.


**For tags use: you may have to use comma "," to split tags**. You can get tips if you insert tags already exsist. Otherwise a new tag will be created.

```

title: note title
tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
notebook: notebook
